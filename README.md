- 👋 Hi, I’m @Michel83406
- 👀 I’m interested in developping applications with MCU AVR 8bits
- 🌱 I am retired, I did a lot of programming but with now obsolete languages ​​such as cobol, fortran, Pascal and visual basic. But I consider myself a novice in 
- the C language, a language that I had never bothered to deepen because I found it too esoteric. And I haven't changed my mind, but you have to adapt!
- 💞️ I’m exploring different chips from ATtiny13A to ATmega644 essentially in DIP packages.I read 3 books in English and 2 in French on AVR programming. 
- (found at Elektor) but only one in English seemed really useful to me.And finally we learn a lot more on the forums, that's why I come to this one
